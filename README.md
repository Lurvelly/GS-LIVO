## System Overview and Principles

GS-LIVO (Gaussian Splatting LiDAR-Inertial-Visual Odometry) is a novel SLAM framework that seamlessly integrates LiDAR, inertial, and visual sensors. The system comprises four key modules:

1. **Global Gaussian Map**: A spatial hash-indexed octree structure that efficiently covers sparse spatial volumes while adapting to various environmental details and scales. This structure enables effective management of large-scale environments with minimal memory overhead.

2. **Gaussian Initialization and Optimization**: The system performs rapid initialization of Gaussians using both LiDAR and visual information, followed by online optimization using photometric gradients. This dual-sensor approach ensures robust and accurate scene representation.

3. **Sliding Window Management**: To maintain real-time performance, GS-LIVO employs an innovative sliding window approach for Gaussian maintenance. This includes:
   - Efficient memory management between CPU and GPU
   - Incremental updates to avoid redundant computations
   - Strategic handling of Gaussians entering and leaving the field of view

4. **State Estimation**: The system utilizes an Iterated Extended Kalman Filter (IESKF) with sequential updates, tightly integrating LiDAR and image measurements. Unlike traditional patch-based methods, GS-LIVO achieves seamless rendering with high visual quality.

Key advantages of our approach include:
- Seamless integration of multiple sensor modalities
- Efficient memory management through sliding window optimization
- High-quality scene representation using Gaussian splatting
- Real-time performance on both high-end GPUs and edge computing devices
